<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>Abstract<br/>
Insert the abstract here. The abstract should summarize your research in clear and concise language. You should write your abstract with the idea that it may be the only section that will actually be read and the sole representation of your research. <br/>
<br/>
Some primary factors that you should consider for the abstract:<br/>
<br/>
Motivation: Why do we care?<br/>
Problem statement: What are you trying to address?<br/>
Approach: How will you address the problem?<br/>
Results: What is the answer or expected answer?<br/>

Cognitive control tasks? What are they? What do they mean? Why?<br/>

<br/>
Cognitive control (1) conflict resolution and (2) monitoring system<br/>
<br/>
which evaluates the need to engage the conflict resolution mechanism (Bialystok et al., 2009; Costa et al., 2009). According to Costa et al. (2009), if the task at hand engages the monitoring system to a large extent, the advantage for b...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Conflict Adaptation</strong><br/>Introduction - Conflict Adaptation<br/>
 Despite the incredible rate at which language language is presented, language users interpret language incrementally as it is presented to them, as opposed to packaging the input as a unit after it has been communicated and interpreting it as a whole. However, there arise cases in which an initial interpretation needs to be re-interpreted, as new information is encountered in the input. For example, as a listener hears the structure in 1, they may initially in...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Second Language Learners - Conflict Adaptation Paradigm</strong><br/>Conflict Adaptation<br/>
 Many sources of information must be coordinated and processed during the online interpretation of sentences by a healthy adult in his or her first language (L1), a process that only becomes more difficult in other populations that must coordinate this information while dealing with certain handicaps, such as impaired cognitive skills as a result of brain damage (in the case of patients) or immature cognitive skill development (in the case of children). <br/>
 Several studies that...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Bilingual Advantage?</strong><br/>Differences between monolinguals and bilinguals<br/>
 Psychological research has revealed that for many populations, the increased use of a certain behavior results in improved skills on similar tasks or associated brain structure differences. For example, Taxi drivers required to pass strict examinations of the streets of London possess more development in the region of the hippocampus associated with spatial navigation (Maguire, Gadian, Johnsrude, Good, Ashburner, Frackowiak, & Frith, 2000). In beh...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>CC - Bilinguals</strong><br/>Cognitive Control in bilinguals<br/>
 One reality of bilingualism is the consistent need to suppress one language according to the context. It’s been shown that a bilingual does not separate the mental lexicons and grammars, but rather that both are active during any language use (Kroll & Bialystok, 2013; Kroll & Sunderman, 2003). Within Green’s (1998) Inhibitory Control Model, the competitor is suppressed by executive control (or cognitive control). That is to say, given two competing forms, the sal...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>CC - HLB</strong><br/>Cognitive Control in Heritage Language Bilinguals<br/>
 As Torres & Sanz (2015) address, many studies that consider bilingual speakers may not sufficiently separate distinct language profiles such as heritage language (HL) bilinguals.  The bilinguals in some research, such as the Catalonians studied in Costa et al (2008), for example, are educated in bilingual schools and therefore, possess an inherently different language profile than the Spanish-English bilinguals in the US who have a certain degre...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>L3 learners</strong><br/>Cognitive Control in L3 learners<br/>
 Beyond this increased understanding of how cognitive control plays a role in Heritage bilinguals’ language processing and conflict resolution, a gap exists in our understanding of the role of cognitive control in language learning as it pertains to bilinguals learning their third language (L3). As mentioned, the different sociolinguistic contexts experienced by different populations of bilinguals (e.g. HL in the US vs. Catalan-Spanish biliterate bilinguals) has ...</p>

The purpose or hypothesis of the research. This is a more general overview of your research.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Research Question</strong><br/>Research Question(s)<br/>
Insert your specific and answerable research question(s) here. Bullet points are OK. The idea is to be as clear as possible.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Importance</strong><br/>Importance of the Project<br/>
The importance of the research including what makes your research unique and/or the specific contribution you seek to make.</p>

The research methodology you will employ including location, data collection techniques, analysis techniques, etc.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Work Plan</strong><br/>Work Plan<br/>
This is arguably the most important part of the proposal as it shows how you will conduct your study. As such, it should be as realistic as possible and very detailed. For my proposal I broke it down by what I intended to accomplish each month.<br/>
<br/>
August<br/>
1. Determine survey questions<br/>
<br/>
October<br/>
2. IRB request - 2 months<br/>
3. Meet with committee<br/>
<br/>
November<br/>
4. Mail surveys<br/>
5. Data Entry<br/>
6. Submit abstract for professional conference paper or poster presentation<br/>
<br/>
December<br/>
7. Data Entry<br/>
<br/>
January<br/>
