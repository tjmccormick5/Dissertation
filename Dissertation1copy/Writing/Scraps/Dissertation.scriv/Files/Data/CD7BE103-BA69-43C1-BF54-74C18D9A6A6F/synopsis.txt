In addition to cognitive controlâ€™s role in ambiguity resolution, it is also of considerable interest during the acquisition of a second language (L2). In brain imaging studies, increased activity is observed in the prefrontal brain region associated with cognitive control during the processing of a non-native, non-highly proficient language (Abutalebi, 2008). However, this increased activity is not observed during proficient or native processing. Behavioral data suggest a similar tendency. In a longitudinal study investigating the relationship between cognitive variables and the automaticity of morphosyntactic structures in Spanish for L2 learners, Serafini and Sanz (2016) found robust correlations for learners at beginning proficiency levels. Advanced learners do not obtain this same relationship between linguistic and non-linguistic behavior. This suggests a decreased reliance on cognitive control at increasing proficiency levels (probably meaning less effort needed to suppress L1 at higher L2 proficiencies). These findings fit within a long line of previous research revealing a differential influence of cognitive function at early but not later stages of language learning (compare Linck & Weiss, 2011; Sagarra & Herschensohn, 2010, vs. Grey, Cox, Serafini & Sanz, 2015; however, see Linck et al., 2013 for a review).
What do we know? What do people investigate instead of this question? WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS? WHERE ARE THE QUESTIONS?
