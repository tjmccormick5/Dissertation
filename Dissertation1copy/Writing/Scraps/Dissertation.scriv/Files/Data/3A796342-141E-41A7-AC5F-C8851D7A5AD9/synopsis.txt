Cognitive individual differences in language acquisition have been an area of much research within psycholinguistics (Pozzan & Trueswell, 2015; Kroll & Sunderman, 2005, among many others), neuroimaging and cognitive psychology (Abutalebi, 2008; Abutalebi & Green, 2007; Indefry, 2006, among others), and Second Language Acquisition (Serafini & Sanz, 2016; Linck et al., 2013, among many others). Many of these studies observe a decreased role of cognitive control as language proficiency develops. Consider the behavioral data collected in previous studies, for example. Serafini & Sanz (2016) conducted a longitudinal study with proficiency as an independent variable. They measured the role of cognitive functions in the acquisition process by comparing automaticity of ten different morphological structures in Spanish, two cognitive variables (cognitive control  and phonological short term memory), within different proficiency groups (beginning, intermediate and advanced learners). The authors only observed robust correlations between linguistic performance and cognitive variables for beginners, while more advanced learners revealed far fewer significant correlations between linguistic and non-linguistic performance, suggesting a decreased reliance on the ability to encode, store and retrieve information as exposure and proficiency increase in classroom learning. While Serafini and Sanz (2016) are among the very first researchers to specifically compare the role of cognitive functions at various points of L2 proficiency using the same assessment measures, their findings do fit within a long line of previous research supporting the finding of a differential influence of cognitive function at early but not later stages of language learning (compare Linck & Weiss, 2011; Sagarra & Herschensohn, 2010, vs. Grey, Cox, Serafini & Sanz, 2015; however, see Linck et al., 2013 for a review).
